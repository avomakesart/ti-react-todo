## Todo App - Instructions:
 **  We need to create a simple to-do app, that lets us create new items and delete those items.
 **

<!--  1.- Fork and clone this repository, doing a: `git clone https://github.com/avomakesart/ti-react-todo.git`
 
 2.- Create an array of default values for the to-do list.
 
 3.- Iterate that array of values in the to-do list.
 
 4.- Now let's begging with the todo form input, add the ability to add new values in the existing array, (input and submit button).
 
 5.- We need to validate if the item is already on the todo list, is that the case then we will need to prevent a duplicate value to be inserted in the todo list.
 
 6.- Now we need to delete items, add a button next to the item and add the ability to delete items.
 
 7.- Extra point: Add a validation, to prevent empty values to be inserted in the todo list.
 
 8.- Extra point: add style to the to-do list.
 
 9.- Extra point: improve the app's performance
 
 
 **  Note: you are free to use any design system or CSS framework/library.**
